# SecureCTF
*Development Period: April 2023 - July 15, 2023*

A three-level Capture The Flag (CTF) web application designed to teach fundamental web security concepts through hands-on challenges. This project was developed over several months to create an engaging, educational platform for learning about web security vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Three Progressive Difficulty Levels:**
  1. Cookie Monster (Basic Cookie Manipulation)
  2. Cryptography Challenge (Base64 + ROT Cipher)
  3. SQL Injection Challenge (Advanced Database Attacks)

- **User Management:**
  - Personal username tracking
  - Session management
  - Progress tracking

- **Leaderboard System:**
  - Real-time completion tracking
  - Time-based scoring
  - Medal system (ðŸ¥‡, ðŸ¥ˆ, ðŸ¥‰)

## Development Timeline

### Week 1 (1â€“7 April)
**What I did:**
- Finalized project proposal with clear scope, objectives, and MoSCoW prioritization.
- Created risk register and mitigation plans.
- Defined MVP and non-MVP features.
- Addressed initial legal/ethical concerns.

**What went well:**
- Strong start to planning phase. Tutor feedback on proposal was largely positive, indicating good alignment with module expectations.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- Struggled initially to distinguish between MVP and stretch goals until after reviewing past EMA exemplars.

**What Iâ€™ll do next week:**
- Start coding backend core functionality, focusing on challenge initiation and flag submission.
---
### Week 2 (8â€“14 April)
**What I did:**
- Implemented `/start-challenge`, `/submit-flag`, and `/leaderboard` endpoints.
- Set up JSON-based storage and basic validation.

**What went well:**
- Backend work came together quickly, with FastAPI proving very efficient.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- Faced issues with CORS until I discovered I hadnâ€™t correctly set headers in FastAPI config.

**What Iâ€™ll do next week:**
- Begin frontend development to interact with backend APIs.
---
### Week 3 (15â€“21 April)
**What I did:**
- Developed core frontend with challenge list, username entry, and leaderboard view.
- Configured CORS correctly and Dockerized the first challenge.

**What went well:**
- Successful API integration and functional UI prototype.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- Docker setup was new territory; required significant debugging.

**What Iâ€™ll do next week:**
- Add admin endpoint and begin backend security improvements.
---
### Week 4 (22â€“28 April)
**What I did:**
- Added admin reset endpoint.
- Hardened backend security and used Swagger UI for documentation.

**What went well:**
- Swagger UI provided a professional touch and made testing easier.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- Discovered leaderboard was vulnerable to tampering due to missing validation step; fixed it.

**What Iâ€™ll do next week:**
- Begin refactoring and review codebase structure.
---
### Week 5 (29 Aprilâ€“5 May)
**What I did:**
- Modularized backend code for maintainability.
- Reorganized GitHub issues and verified all endpoint functionality.

**What went well:**
- Code quality and traceability significantly improved.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- Realized some of my early Git commits lacked descriptive messages, which made tracking harder.

**What Iâ€™ll do next week:**
- Start frontend enhancements and form-based flag submission.
---
### Week 6 (6â€“12 May)
**What I did:**
- Refactored backend validation logic.
- Started frontend design for improved UX (e.g. navigation, inputs).

**What went well:**
- Refactored functions now easier to test and reuse.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- I overcomplicated form handling before simplifying it using controlled components in React.

**What Iâ€™ll do next week:**
- Finish and test updated frontend workflows.
---
### Week 7 (13â€“19 May)
**What I did:**
- Implemented frontend flag submission form and improved challenge navigation.
- Developed `/challenges/{id}` endpoint for dynamic challenge details.

**What went well:**
- Seamless integration between frontend and new endpoint.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- Small bug in challenge ID parsing delayed UI testing.

**What Iâ€™ll do next week:**
- Final polish of current features and prepare for documentation.
---
### Week 8 (20â€“27 May)
**What I did:**
- Conducted final review and updated documentation.
- Compiled logs, test evidence, and milestone status for TMA02.

**What went well:**
- Documentation is clean and traceable to GitHub history.

**What didnâ€™t go well:**
- Slight time crunch in compiling screenshots and evidence.

**What Iâ€™ll do next:**
- Submit TMA02 and shift focus to challenge enhancements and user feedback cycle in TMA03.
